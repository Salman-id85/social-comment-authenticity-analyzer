# Comment Checker 

**Comment Checker** is a Python-based tool that analyzes the authenticity of social media comments across platforms like **YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), LinkedIn**, and also from CSV inputs.  
It applies **heuristic rules** (not heavy ML) to detect spammy or inauthentic patterns and generates a **PDF report** with detailed analysis and a pie chart visualization.
